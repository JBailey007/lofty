# Lofty 

## Why was this project created?
We created this app in order to break down goals into smaller actually achievable goals. Often, people have huge goals or dreams. But the overwhelm is very real. Breaking a lofty goal into smaller goals and then breaking those goals into even smaller tasks was the idea of this project.
