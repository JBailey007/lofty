# Lofty 

## Why was this project created?
We created this app in order to break down goals into smaller actually achievable goals. Often, people have huge goals or dreams. But the overwhelm is very real. Breaking a lofty goal into smaller goals and then breaking those goals into even smaller tasks was the idea of this project.

We divided the groups based on our strengths. Everyone worked on some aspects of the frontend and the backend, we did a lot of coding together within the group in meetings, this way we all learned new skills and helped with strengths and weeknesses. Liz Made our Canva.
